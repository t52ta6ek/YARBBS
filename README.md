# YARBBS
Sources to Your Average Remote Bulletin Board System (YARBSS)

May 1, 2023 - Stay tuned for the Turbo Pascal source code of the CP/M version of YARBSS. This was the 2nd version of the BBS. I wrote the first version for the PolyMorphic Systems 8813 computer in BASIC. I need to organize the sources and associated database creation utilities which I've likely forgotten how to use in all the decades since.
